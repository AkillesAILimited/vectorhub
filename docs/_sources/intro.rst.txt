What is Vector Hub?
==============================

The home of ___2Vec Models.

The rise of deep learning and encoding has meant that there are now explosion of
open-source and proprietary models and techniques that have allowed for distributed
representation of entities. This means the rise of new ____2Vec models that are:

1) Model-specific - New architecture is introduced.
2) Domain-specific - Architecture is trained on new domain.
3) Language-specific - Architecture is trained in new language.
4) Task-specific - Architecture is trained on new task.

In order to allow people to understand what these models do and mean, we aim to provide 
a hub for these __2vec models.

Our vision to build a hub that allows people to store these ____2Vec models and provide explanations
for how to best use these encodings while building a flexible framework that allows these 
different models to be used easily.
